# MCP Command Implementation Plan (Version 2.0)

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of the MCP command is to allow users to issue natural language instructions (e.g., "use MCP to check my stripe balance") and have a seamless interaction that:

- Discovers the relevant MCP server supporting the requested functionality.
- Sets up, launches, and configures the MCP server if needed.
- Utilizes an MCP client (written in TypeScript) to interact with the server.
- Leverages an integrated LLM driver to translate high-level instructions into concrete MCP server calls.
- Returns the final answer, along with logging and metadata per cursor-tools guidelines.

**User Experience Focus:** The intent is to hide complexity so that users interact naturally without needing to know underlying details.

## 2. Requirements and Core Objectives

- **Natural-Language Interface:** Accept a wide range of user inputs and extract the intended task.
- **Robustness:** Implement error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms for issues such as network errors and miscommunications with the LLM.
- **Security:** Manage sensitive details (e.g., API keys) securely via environment variables or secure storage. Validate and sanitize all inputs and outputs.
- **Modularity:** Separate concerns into distinct components: parsing, server discovery, process management, client interaction, LLM translation, output formatting, and cleanup.
- **Extensibility:** Use a structured configuration (e.g., `mcp-config.json`) to allow easy addition or updates of MCP servers.

## 3. Architecture Components and Design

### A. Command Parsing & Natural Language Processing

- **Input Handling:** Accept CLI input (e.g., `mcp check my stripe balance`).
- **Semantic Extraction:** Use keyword matching and/or an LLM helper to extract critical intents (like 'stripe' and 'balance').

### B. MCP Server Discovery and Configuration

- **Local Configuration:** Utilize a structured `mcp-config.json` file. A sample schema:

  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "stripe": {
        "name": "Stripe Server",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@mcp/stripe-server"],
        "port": 12345,
        "config": {
          "apiKey": "<env:STRIPE_API_KEY>"
        }
      }
      // Additional servers...
    }
  }
  ```

- **Marketplace Metadata:** Leverage cached metadata (e.g., from `local-research/mcp-marketplace-docs.md` and `mcp-directories.txt`) to discover servers dynamically if not pre-configured.
- **Fallback:** If no matching server is found automatically, prompt the user with guidance to configure one manually or consult the MCP Marketplace.

### C. MCP Server Setup and Lifecycle Management

- **Launching Servers:** Spawn the MCP server using its specified command and arguments if it isn't already running.
- **Monitoring:** Implement process tracking to ensure the server starts correctly and remains active.
- **Cleanup:** Gracefully terminate spawned processes when done or if errors occur.

### D. MCP Client Interaction

- **Initialization:** Use the MCP TypeScript client (e.g., `MCPConnectionManager`) to establish a connection.
- **Tool Enumeration:** Query the server for available tools or endpoints.
- **Invocation:** Call the correct tool (e.g., a "getStripeBalance" endpoint) with the required parameters.

### E. LLM-Assisted Instruction Translation

- **Prompt Engineering:** Integrate an LLM driver to convert natural language instructions into precise tool calls and parameter sets. For instance, prompt: "How do I use this MCP server to check my stripe balance?"
- **Error Handling:** Have fallback strategies if the LLM output is ambiguous or invalid, such as re-prompting or using default parameters.
- **Future Considerations:** Plan for potential multi-turn interactions if instructions require complex, sequential MCP calls.

### F. Output Formatting and User Feedback

- **Result Aggregation:** Combine the MCP server response with meta-information (logs, status codes) as per cursor-tools guidelines.
- **User Messaging:** Provide clear, friendly feedback for both successful and error scenarios.

### G. Security and Configuration Management

- **API Key Management:** Handle secrets like Stripe API keys securely via environment variables or secure config options.
- **Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all incoming and outgoing data to prevent security issues.

## 4. Detailed Implementation Workflow

1. **Command Parsing and Validation:**
   - Accept and parse the user input (e.g., "mcp check my stripe balance").
   - Extract keywords and determine the intent using a combination of regex/keyword matching and LLM-based interpretation if needed.

2. **MCP Server Discovery and Selection:**
   - Load local configuration from `mcp-config.json`.
   - Match the intent with a pre-configured server (e.g., the "stripe" server).
   - If no match is found, consult cached marketplace metadata and, if necessary, prompt the user to manually configure a server.

3. **Server Setup and Launch:**
   - If the target server is not running, spawn it using its defined command and arguments.
   - Monitor the process to ensure successful startup and readiness.

4. **Client Connection and Tool Enumeration:**
   - Initialize the MCP client using `MCPConnectionManager`.
   - Establish a connection to the selected server and retrieve the list of tools/endpoints.
   - Verify that the required tool for the task (e.g., "getStripeBalance") is available.

5. **LLM-Assisted Translation of User Instruction:**
   - Pass the user instruction into the LLM driver to determine the precise tool call and parameters.
   - Use few-shot examples in the prompt to improve reliability and validate the LLM's output.
   - If the LLM output is invalid or ambiguous, apply fallback strategies (e.g., re-prompt or use default behavior).

6. **Tool Invocation and Result Retrieval:**
   - Invoke the selected tool via the MCP client with the parameters from the LLM's translation.
   - Handle any errors using defined MCP protocol error codes and implement retries for transient failures.

7. **Formatting and Returning the Output:**
   - Collate and format the MCP server's response with additional diagnostic information.
   - Output the final result to the user consistent with cursor-tools guidelines.

8. **Cleanup and Comprehensive Error Handling:**
   - Ensure all spawned MCP server processes are terminated after command execution.
   - Log detailed error information and implement configurable retry mechanisms.
   - Provide clear user errors and recommendations for corrective actions in case of persistent failures.

## 5. Roadmap: MVP vs. V1

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP aims to deliver a basic working prototype that demonstrates core functionality:

- **Basic Command Parsing:**
  - Accept and parse a simple CLI command (e.g., "mcp check my stripe balance").
  - Extract key intents using basic keyword matching (LLM integration can be simplified or simulated).

- **Static MCP Server Discovery:**
  - Load a pre-configured `mcp-config.json` and select a hard-coded server (e.g., the "stripe" server).
  - Use a minimal schema without dynamic marketplace metadata lookup.

- **Server Launch & Client Initialization:**
  - Spawn the server if not running, using basic process management.
  - Initialize the MCP client and enumerate available tools (assume the required tool exists).

- **Simplified LLM Translation:**
  - Either use a basic LLM call with minimal prompt engineering or map the instruction to predetermined parameters.
  - No advanced fallback strategies required.

- **Tool Invocation & Output:**
  - Invoke the tool (e.g., "getStripeBalance") with fixed/default parameters.
  - Format and return the result with basic error logging.

- **Basic Cleanup:**
  - Terminate any spawned processes on completion.
  - Implement rudimentary error handling without advanced retry mechanisms.
