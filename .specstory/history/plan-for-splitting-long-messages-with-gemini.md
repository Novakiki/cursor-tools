## Plan for Splitting Long Messages with Gemini (20/02/2025, 16:32:01)

_**User**_

we get an error with the openai provider
    message: "Invalid 'messages[1].content': string too long. Expected a string with maximum length 1048576, but got a string with length 1148649 instead.",

with open ai specifically (not the base provider) we need to split long message content into multiple messages. Make a plan with gemini for how to do this. Make the changes and ask gemini to review

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help break this down into steps. First, let's get Gemini's help to plan the implementation.

```bash
pnpm dev repo "We need to modify the OpenAIProvider class to handle long messages by splitting them into multiple messages when the content length exceeds OpenAI's limit of 1048576 characters. Please provide a detailed implementation plan for how to do this while maintaining the conversation context."

mplementation plan to modify
 the `OpenAIProvider` class to handle long messages by splitting them into multi
ple messages when the content length exceeds OpenAI's limit.\n\n**Implementation
 Plan:**\n\n**Step 1:  Create a Message Chunking Utility Function**\n\nWe will c
reate a utility function to split a long text message into smaller chunks that a
re within OpenAI's character limit. This function will be placed in a new file,
`src/utils/messageChunker.ts`, to keep the provider code clean and utilities reu
sable.\n\n```typescript\n// src/utils/messageChunker.ts\nexport function chunkMe
ssage(message: string, limit: number): string[] {\n  if (message.length <= limit
) {\n    return [message];\n  }\n\n  const chunks: string[] = [];\n  let current
Chunk = '';\n  const sentences = message.split(/(?<!\\w\\.\\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\\.
)(?<=\\.|\\?|\\!)\\s/g); // Split by sentences\n\n  for (const sentence of sente
nces) {\n    if (currentChunk.length + sentence.length + 1 <= limit) { // +1 for
 space\n      currentChunk += (currentChunk ? ' ' : '') + sentence;\n    } else
{\n      if (currentChunk) {\n        chunks.push(currentChunk);\n      }\n
 currentChunk = sentence;\n      // If a single sentence is longer than the limi
t, force split it\n      if (currentChunk.length > limit) {\n        const words
 = currentChunk.split(' ');\n        let currentSentenceChunk = '';\n        for
 (const word of words) {\n          if (currentSentenceChunk.length + word.lengt
h + 1 <= limit) {\n            currentSentenceChunk += (currentSentenceChunk ? '
 ' : '') + word;\n          } else {\n            if (currentSentenceChunk) {\n
             chunks.push(currentSentenceChunk);\n            }\n            curr
entSentenceChunk = word;\n            if (currentSentenceChunk.length > limit) {
 // Even a word is too long, force split chars\n              let currentWordChu
nk = '';\n              for (const char of currentWordChunk) {\n
if (currentWordChunk.length + 1 <= limit) {\n                  currentWordChunk
+= char;\n                } else {\n                  if (currentWordChunk) {\n
                   chunks.push(currentWordChunk);\n                  }\n
          currentWordChunk = char;\n                }\n              }\n
      if (currentWordChunk) {\n                chunks.push(currentWordChunk);\n
             }\n              currentSentenceChunk = ''; // Reset sentence chunk
 after force splitting word\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        if (
currentSentenceChunk) {\n          chunks.push(currentSentenceChunk);\n        }
\n        currentChunk = ''; // Reset current chunk after force splitting senten
ce\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (currentChunk) {\n    chunks.push(currentChunk);
\n  }\n\n  return chunks;\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Modify `OpenAIBase.executePrompt`
 to Utilize Chunking**\n\nModify the `executePrompt` method in `src/providers/ba
se.ts` within the `OpenAIBase` class to use the `chunkMessage` function. We will
 iterate through the chunks and send them sequentially to OpenAI, accumulating t
he responses.\n\n```typescript\n// src/providers/base.ts\nimport type { Config }
 from '../types';\nimport { loadConfig, loadEnv } from '../config';\nimport Open
AI from 'openai';\nimport { ApiKeyMissingError, ModelNotFoundError, NetworkError
, ProviderError } from '../errors';\nimport { exhaustiveMatchGuard } from '../ut
ils/exhaustiveMatchGuard';\nimport { chunkMessage } from '../utils/messageChunke
r'; // Import chunkMessage\n\n// ... rest of the file ...\n\n// Base class for O
penAI-compatible providers (OpenAI and OpenRouter)\nabstract class OpenAIBase ex
tends BaseProvider {\n  // ... constructor ...\n\n  async executePrompt(prompt:
string, options?: ModelOptions): Promise<string> {\n    const model = this.getMo
del(options);\n    const maxTokens = this.getMaxTokens(options);\n    const syst
emPrompt = this.getSystemPrompt(options);\n    const messageLimit = 1048576; //
OpenAI's character limit\n\n    const promptChunks = chunkMessage(prompt, messag
eLimit);\n    let combinedResponseContent = '';\n\n    for (const chunk of promp
tChunks) {\n      try {\n        const response = await this.client.chat.complet
ions.create({\n          model,\n          messages: [\n            ...(systemPr
ompt ? [{ role: 'system' as const, content: systemPrompt }] : []),\n
{ role: 'user' as const, content: chunk },\n          ],\n          ...(model.st
artsWith('o') ? {\n            max_completion_tokens: maxTokens,\n          } :
{\n            max_tokens: maxTokens,\n          })\n        });\n        const
content = response.choices[0].message.content;\n        if (content) {\n
  combinedResponseContent += content + '\\n'; // Append chunk response\n
} else {\n          console.warn(`${this.constructor.name} returned an empty res
ponse chunk.`);\n        }\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(`Erro
r in ${this.constructor.name} executePrompt chunk`, error);\n        if (error i
nstanceof ProviderError) {\n          throw error;\n        }\n        throw new
 NetworkError(`Failed to communicate with ${this.constructor.name} API`, error);
\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (!combinedResponseContent.trim()) {\n      throw new
ProviderError(`${this.constructor.name} returned an overall empty response after
 processing chunks.`);\n    }\n    return combinedResponseContent.trim();\n  }\n
}\n\n// ... rest of the file ...\n```\n\n**Step 3: Testing**\n\n1.  **Create a l
ong test input:** Create a text file (`long-test-input.txt`) with content signif
icantly exceeding OpenAI's character limit. You can fill it with repeated senten
ces or paragraphs.\n2.  **Modify `repo.ts` to test:**  Temporarily modify the `r
epo` command in `src/commands/repo.ts` to read the content of `long-test-input.t
xt` instead of packing the repository. This will simulate a very long repository
 context.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // src/commands/repo.ts\n    import type { C
ommand, CommandGenerator, CommandOptions } from '../types';\n    import type { C
onfig } from '../types';\n    import { loadConfig, loadEnv } from '../config';\n
    import { pack } from 'repomix'; // <-- remove this line\n    import { readFi
leSync } from 'node:fs'; // <-- add this line\n    import { FileError, ProviderE
rror } from '../errors';\n    import type { ModelOptions, BaseModelProvider } fr
om '../providers/base';\n    import { createProvider } from '../providers/base';
\n    import { ignorePatterns, includePatterns, outputOptions } from '../repomix
/repomixConfig';\n\n    export class RepoCommand implements Command {\n      //
... constructor ...\n\n      async *execute(query: string, options?: CommandOpti
ons): CommandGenerator {\n        try {\n          yield 'Using long test input.
..\\n'; // <-- change this line\n          let repoContext: string;\n          t
ry {\n            repoContext = readFileSync('long-test-input.txt', 'utf-8'); //
 <-- change this line and path to your test file\n          } catch (error) {\n
           throw new FileError('Failed to read long test input', error); // <--
change error message\n          }\n          // ... rest of the execute method .
..\n        } catch (error) {\n          // ... error handling ...\n        }\n
     }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Run the `repo` command:** Execute the `repo` com
mand with a simple query that triggers the code path to use `OpenAIProvider`.\n\
n    ```bash\n    pnpm dev repo \"Summarize the repository content.\" --provider
 openai\n    ```\n\n4.  **Observe the output:** Verify that the command executes
 without errors and that you get a meaningful summary, even though the input was
 very long. Check the console output for any warnings or errors from the chunkin
g or OpenAI calls.\n\n5.  **Revert `repo.ts`:** After testing, remember to rever
t the changes in `src/commands/repo.ts` to its original state, so it packs the a
ctual repository again.\n\n**Step 4: Documentation Update**\n\nNo significant do
cumentation update is needed as this change is an internal improvement and doesn
't change the user-facing command behavior or options.\n\nThis detailed plan sho
uld allow you to implement message chunking in `OpenAIProvider` effectively. Rem
ember to test thoroughly after implementation. Let me know if you have any quest
ions or need further assistance."

Okay, I have analyzed your request and here is a detailed implementation plan to
 modify the `OpenAIProvider`
 class to handle long messages by splitting them into multiple messages when the
 content length exceeds OpenAI's limit.
                                                        
**Implementation Plan:**

**Step 1:  Create a Message Chunking Utility Function**

We will create a utility function to split a long text message into smaller chun
ks that are within OpenAI's 
character limit. This function will be placed in a new file, `src/utils/messageC
hunker.ts`, to keep the provider code clean and utilities reusable.
                                                        
```typescript
// src/utils/messageChunker.ts
export function chunkMessage(message: string, limit: number): string[] {
  if (message.length <= limit) {
    return [message];
  }

  const chunks: string[] = [];
  let currentChunk = '';
  const sentences = message.split(/(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?|\!)\s/
g); // Split by sentences

  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    if (currentChunk.length + sentence.length + 1 <= limit) { // +1 for space
      currentChunk += (currentChunk ? ' ' : '') + sentence;
    } else {
      if (currentChunk) {
        chunks.push(currentChunk);
      }
      currentChunk = sentence;
      // If a single sentence is longer than the limit, force split it
      if (currentChunk.length > limit) {
        const words = currentChunk.split(' ');
        let currentSentenceChunk = '';
        for (const word of words) {
          if (currentSentenceChunk.length + word.length + 1 <= limit) {
            currentSentenceChunk += (currentSentenceChunk ? ' ' : '') + word;
          } else {
            if (currentSentenceChunk) {
              chunks.push(currentSentenceChunk);
            }
            currentSentenceChunk = word;
            if (currentSentenceChunk.length > limit) { // Even a word is too lon
g, force split chars
              let currentWordChunk = '';
              for (const char of currentWordChunk) {
                if (currentWordChunk.length + 1 <= limit) {
                  currentWordChunk += char;
                } else {
                  if (currentWordChunk) {
                    chunks.push(currentWordChunk);
                  }
                  currentWordChunk = char;
                }
              }
              if (currentWordChunk) {
                chunks.push(currentWordChunk);
              }
              currentSentenceChunk = ''; // Reset sentence chunk after force spl
itting word
            }
          }
        }
        if (currentSentenceChunk) {
          chunks.push(currentSentenceChunk);
        }
        currentChunk = ''; // Reset current chunk after force splitting sentence
      }
    }
  }

  if (currentChunk) {
    chunks.push(currentChunk);
  }

  return chunks;
}
```

**Step 2: Modify `OpenAIBase.executePrompt` to Utilize Chunking**

Modify the `executePrompt` method in `src/providers/base.ts` within the `OpenAIB
ase` class to use the `chunk
Message` function. We will iterate through the chunks and send them sequentially
 to OpenAI, accumulating the responses.
                                                        
```typescript
// src/providers/base.ts
import type { Config } from '../types';
import { loadConfig, loadEnv } from '../config';
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { ApiKeyMissingError, ModelNotFoundError, NetworkError, ProviderError } f
rom '../errors';
import { exhaustiveMatchGuard } from '../utils/exhaustiveMatchGuard';
import { chunkMessage } from '../utils/messageChunker'; // Import chunkMessage

// ... rest of the file ...

// Base class for OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI and OpenRouter)
abstract class OpenAIBase extends BaseProvider {
  // ... constructor ...

  async executePrompt(prompt: string, options?: ModelOptions): Promise<string> {
    const model = this.getModel(options);
    const maxTokens = this.getMaxTokens(options);
    const systemPrompt = this.getSystemPrompt(options);
    const messageLimit = 1048576; // OpenAI's character limit

    const promptChunks = chunkMessage(prompt, messageLimit);
    let combinedResponseContent = '';

    for (const chunk of promptChunks) {
      try {
        const response = await this.client.chat.completions.create({
          model,
          messages: [
            ...(systemPrompt ? [{ role: 'system' as const, content: systemPrompt
 }] : []),
            { role: 'user' as const, content: chunk },
          ],
          ...(model.startsWith('o') ? {
            max_completion_tokens: maxTokens,
          } : {
            max_tokens: maxTokens,
          })
        });
        const content = response.choices[0].message.content;
        if (content) {
          combinedResponseContent += content + '\n'; // Append chunk response
        } else {
          console.warn(`${this.constructor.name} returned an empty response chun
k.`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error in ${this.constructor.name} executePrompt chunk`, e
rror);
        if (error instanceof ProviderError) {
          throw error;
        }
        throw new NetworkError(`Failed to communicate with ${this.constructor.na
me} API`, error);
      }
    }

    if (!combinedResponseContent.trim()) {
      throw new ProviderError(`${this.constructor.name} returned an overall empt
y response after processing 
chunks.`);
                                }
    return combinedResponseContent.trim();
  }
}

// ... rest of the file ...
```

**Step 3: Testing**

1.  **Create a long test input:** Create a text file (`long-test-input.txt`) wit
h content significantly exce
eding OpenAI's character limit. You can fill it with repeated sentences or parag
raphs.                      2.  **Modify `repo.ts` to test:**  Temporarily modif
y the `repo` command in `src/commands/repo.ts` to read t
he content of `long-test-input.txt` instead of packing the repository. This will
 simulate a very long repository context.
                                                        
    ```typescript
    // src/commands/repo.ts
    import type { Command, CommandGenerator, CommandOptions } from '../types';
    import type { Config } from '../types';
    import { loadConfig, loadEnv } from '../config';
    import { pack } from 'repomix'; // <-- remove this line
    import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'; // <-- add this line
    import { FileError, ProviderError } from '../errors';
    import type { ModelOptions, BaseModelProvider } from '../providers/base';
    import { createProvider } from '../providers/base';
    import { ignorePatterns, includePatterns, outputOptions } from '../repomix/r
epomixConfig';

    export class RepoCommand implements Command {
      // ... constructor ...

      async *execute(query: string, options?: CommandOptions): CommandGenerator
{
        try {
          yield 'Using long test input...\n'; // <-- change this line
          let repoContext: string;
          try {
            repoContext = readFileSync('long-test-input.txt', 'utf-8'); // <-- c
hange this line and path to 
your test file
                                      } catch (error) {
            throw new FileError('Failed to read long test input', error); // <--
 change error message
          }
          // ... rest of the execute method ...
        } catch (error) {
          // ... error handling ...
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Run the `repo` command:** Execute the `repo` command with a simple query t
hat triggers the code path t
o use `OpenAIProvider`.
                            
    ```bash
    pnpm dev repo "Summarize the repository content." --provider openai
    ```

4.  **Observe the output:** Verify that the command executes without errors and
that you get a meaningful su
mmary, even though the input was very long. Check the console output for any war
nings or errors from the chunking or OpenAI calls.
                                                        
5.  **Revert `repo.ts`:** After testing, remember to revert the changes in `src/
commands/repo.ts` to its ori
ginal state, so it packs the actual repository again.
                            
**Step 4: Documentation Update**

No significant documentation update is needed as this change is an internal impr
ovement and doesn't change t
he user-facing command behavior or options.
                            
This detailed plan should allow you to implement message chunking in `OpenAIProv
ider` effectively. Remember 
to test thoroughly after implementation. Let me know if you have any questions o
r need further assistance.

Great! Gemini has provided a detailed implementation plan. Let's implement it step by step.

1. First, let's create the message chunker utility:

Now, let's modify the OpenAIProvider to use the chunking functionality. We'll override the executePrompt method specifically for OpenAI:

---

```diff
  import { ApiKeyMissingError, ModelNotFoundError, NetworkError, ProviderError } from '../errors';

_**User**_

hm, can we do this more like. binary search? Go to the middle of the message and find the nearest good splitting point (newline, full stop plus space  etc.) and then repeat that as required 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's a smarter approach! A binary search-like strategy would be more efficient and cleaner. Let me modify the message chunker:

 the `messageChunker.ts` implementation based on your questions:\n\n**1. Logic Soundness:**\n\n*   **`findNe
arestSplitPoint` Function:**\n    *   The regex `/[.!?]\\s|\\n/g` correctly targets sentence boundaries (per
iod, exclamation, question mark followed by whitespace) and newlines.\n    *   The `while` loop iterates thr
ough all matches and keeps track of the `lastMatch` that occurs *before* `targetIndex`. This seems logically
 correct to find the best split point before exceeding the limit.\n    *   The fallback to `text.lastIndexOf
(' ', targetIndex)` if no sentence boundary is found or `lastMatch <= 0` is a reasonable approach to split a
t the nearest space.\n    *   Returning `targetIndex` if no space is found before `targetIndex` handles the
case where there are no spaces within the limit, forcing a split at the limit itself.\n\n*   **`chunkMessage
` Function:**\n    *   The initial check `if (message.length <= limit)` is a good optimization for short mes
sages, avoiding unnecessary processing.\n    *   The `while (remainingText.length > 0)` loop ensures that th
e entire message is processed.\n    *   Calling `findNearestSplitPoint(remainingText, limit)` to get the `sp
litIndex` is the core logic and appears to be used correctly.\n    *   Using `actualSplitIndex = splitIndex
> 0 ? splitIndex : limit;` handles the edge case where `findNearestSplitPoint` might return `0` (though it's
 unlikely given the logic, but good to be robust) or no valid split point is found, forcing a split at the `
limit`.\n    *   `remainingText.slice(0, actualSplitIndex).trim()` extracts the chunk and trims whitespace,
which is good practice.\n    *   `remainingText = remainingText.slice(actualSplitIndex).trim()` updates the
`remainingText` correctly for the next iteration.\n\n    **Overall Logic Assessment:** The core logic for fi
nding split points and chunking the message looks sound and reasonably robust.\n\n**2. Edge Cases:**\n\n*
**Very long sentences without sentence boundaries:** The code handles this by falling back to space splittin
g and then finally splitting at the `limit` character if no space is found within the limit. This is a good
fallback strategy.\n*   **Messages shorter than the limit:** Handled efficiently by the initial `if (message
.length <= limit)` check, directly returning the message in an array.\n*   **Empty messages:** Should be han
dled correctly as the `while` loop will terminate immediately if `remainingText` is empty.\n*   **Messages w
ith unusual sentence structures (e.g., no spaces after punctuation):** The regex expects whitespace after pu
nctuation. If sentences end with punctuation but no space, it won't be considered a sentence boundary. Howev
er, the fallback to space splitting should still provide reasonable chunking.\n*   **Performance for very la
rge messages:** The `while` loop in `findNearestSplitPoint` and `chunkMessage` iterates through the message,
 which is linear in complexity relative to the message length. For extremely large messages, performance mig
ht be a concern, but for typical use cases, it should be acceptable.\n\n    **Edge Case Assessment:** The co
de seems to handle most obvious edge cases gracefully, with reasonable fallback mechanisms.\n\n**3. Efficien
cy:**\n\n*   **Regex in `findNearestSplitPoint`:** Regex operations can sometimes be less performant than si
mple string operations, but for sentence boundary detection, regex is a concise and effective tool. The rege
x used is relatively simple and should not be a major performance bottleneck.\n*   **`while` loops:** Both f
unctions use `while` loops. In `findNearestSplitPoint`, the loop iterates through regex matches, and in `chu
nkMessage`, it iterates through the remaining text. The overall time complexity is roughly linear in the len
gth of the input message, which is generally considered efficient for text processing tasks.\n*   **`slice`
and `trim`:** String `slice` and `trim` operations are generally efficient in JavaScript.\n\n    **Efficienc
y Assessment:** The implementation appears to be reasonably efficient for typical text chunking tasks. For e
xtremely large messages, some performance optimizations might be possible, but for most use cases, the curre
nt efficiency should be sufficient.\n\n**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **More Robust Sentence Bou
ndary Detection:** The current regex `/[.!?]\\s|\\n/g` is a good start, but it could be expanded to be more
robust in detecting sentence boundaries. For example, it could consider:\n    *   Handling cases where sente
nce-ending punctuation is followed by more than one space. `/[.!?]\\s+/g`\n    *   Considering quotation mar
ks after punctuation (e.g., \"Hello!\".He said).\n    *   Handling abbreviations (e.g., \"Mr.\", \"Dr.\") to
 avoid splitting after them. This is complex and might require a more sophisticated NLP approach, which migh
t be overkill for this utility.\n*   **Consider different splitting strategies if no sentence boundary is fo
und:** Instead of just falling back to the last space, you could consider:\n    *   Splitting at commas or s
emicolons as secondary split points.\n    *   If absolutely no sentence boundaries or spaces are found withi
n the limit, force a split at the character limit, but potentially warn the user that the chunk might break
words in the middle.\n*   **Binary Search-like approach clarification:** The description mentions \"binary s
earch-like approach\" but the implementation doesn't really use binary search. It's more of a greedy approac
h, finding the *last* valid split point before the limit.  It might be more accurate to describe it as a \"g
reedy, boundary-aware chunking\" or simply \"iterative, boundary-aware chunking\". Or, if there's no plan to
 implement a binary search approach, just remove that phrase for clarity.\n*   **Add comments for complex lo
gic:** While the code is relatively clear, adding comments to explain the fallback logic in `findNearestSpli
tPoint` and the purpose of `actualSplitIndex` in `chunkMessage` could improve readability for others.\n\n**E
xample of Improved Regex (More robust whitespace handling):**\n\n```javascript\nconst splitRegex = /[.!?]\\s
+|\\n/g; // Matches one or more whitespace characters after punctuation\n```\n\n**Improved `findNearestSplit
Point` with comma/semicolon fallback:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction findNearestSplitPoint(text: string, targe
tIndex: number): number {\n    const sentenceSplitRegex = /[.!?]\\s+|\\n/g; // More robust whitespace\n    l
et lastMatch = 0;\n    let match;\n\n    while ((match = sentenceSplitRegex.exec(text)) !== null) {\n
 if (match.index > targetIndex) {\n            break;\n        }\n        lastMatch = match.index + match[0]
.length;\n    }\n\n    if (lastMatch <= 0) {\n        const secondarySplitRegex = /[,;]\\s+|\\s/g; // Comma,
 semicolon, or space\n        while ((match = secondarySplitRegex.exec(text)) !== null) {\n            if (m
atch.index > targetIndex) {\n                break;\n            }\n            lastMatch = match.index + ma
tch[0].length;\n        }\n        if (lastMatch <= 0) {\n            return targetIndex; // Force split at
limit if no better point found\n        }\n    }\n    return lastMatch;\n}\n```\n\n**Summary and Recommendat
ions:**\n\n1.  **Logic Soundness:** The core logic is sound and effectively addresses the requirement of chu
nking messages at sentence boundaries while respecting the character limit.\n2.  **Edge Cases:** The code ha
ndles most common edge cases well, with reasonable fallback strategies.\n3.  **Efficiency:** The implementat
ion is reasonably efficient for typical use cases, with roughly linear time complexity.\n4.  **Improvements:
**\n    *   Consider using the more robust regex `/[.!?]\\s+|\\n/g` in `findNearestSplitPoint` to handle mul
tiple whitespace characters after sentence-ending punctuation.\n    *   Optionally, enhance `findNearestSpli
tPoint` to consider commas/semicolons as secondary split points if no sentence boundaries are found. (Exampl
e provided above).\n    *   Clarify the description of \"binary search-like approach\" as it's not a binary
search implementation.\n    *   Add comments to the code, especially in `findNearestSplitPoint`, to explain
the logic and fallback strategies.\n\nOverall, the `messageChunker.ts` implementation is well-structured and
 functional. The suggested improvements are mostly enhancements for robustness and clarity rather than criti
cal fixes."

Okay, let's review the `messageChunker.ts` implementation based on your questions:

**1. Logic Soundness:**

*   **`findNearestSplitPoint` Function:**
    *   The regex `/[.!?]\s|\n/g` correctly targets sentence boundaries (period, exclamation, question mark 
followed by whitespace) and newlines.
    *   The `while` loop iterates through all matches and keeps track of the `lastMatch` that occurs *before
* `targetIndex`. This seems logically correct to find the best split point before exceeding the limit.
    *   The fallback to `text.lastIndexOf(' ', targetIndex)` if no sentence boundary is found or `lastMatch 
<= 0` is a reasonable approach to split at the nearest space.
    *   Returning `targetIndex` if no space is found before `targetIndex` handles the case where there are n
o spaces within the limit, forcing a split at the limit itself.

*   **`chunkMessage` Function:**
    *   The initial check `if (message.length <= limit)` is a good optimization for short messages, avoiding
 unnecessary processing.
    *   The `while (remainingText.length > 0)` loop ensures that the entire message is processed.
    *   Calling `findNearestSplitPoint(remainingText, limit)` to get the `splitIndex` is the core logic and 
appears to be used correctly.
    *   Using `actualSplitIndex = splitIndex > 0 ? splitIndex : limit;` handles the edge case where `findNea
restSplitPoint` might return `0` (though it's unlikely given the logic, but good to be robust) or no valid s
plit point is found, forcing a split at the `limit`.
    *   `remainingText.slice(0, actualSplitIndex).trim()` extracts the chunk and trims whitespace, which is 
good practice.
    *   `remainingText = remainingText.slice(actualSplitIndex).trim()` updates the `remainingText` correctly
 for the next iteration.

    **Overall Logic Assessment:** The core logic for finding split points and chunking the message looks sou
nd and reasonably robust.

**2. Edge Cases:**

*   **Very long sentences without sentence boundaries:** The code handles this by falling back to space spli
tting and then finally splitting at the `limit` character if no space is found within the limit. This is a g
ood fallback strategy.
*   **Messages shorter than the limit:** Handled efficiently by the initial `if (message.length <= limit)` c
heck, directly returning the message in an array.
*   **Empty messages:** Should be handled correctly as the `while` loop will terminate immediately if `remai
ningText` is empty.
*   **Messages with unusual sentence structures (e.g., no spaces after punctuation):** The regex expects whi
tespace after punctuation. If sentences end with punctuation but no space, it won't be considered a sentence
 boundary. However, the fallback to space splitting should still provide reasonable chunking.
*   **Performance for very large messages:** The `while` loop in `findNearestSplitPoint` and `chunkMessage` 
iterates through the message, which is linear in complexity relative to the message length. For extremely la
rge messages, performance might be a concern, but for typical use cases, it should be acceptable.

    **Edge Case Assessment:** The code seems to handle most obvious edge cases gracefully, with reasonable f
allback mechanisms.

**3. Efficiency:**

*   **Regex in `findNearestSplitPoint`:** Regex operations can sometimes be less performant than simple stri
ng operations, but for sentence boundary detection, regex is a concise and effective tool. The regex used is
 relatively simple and should not be a major performance bottleneck.
*   **`while` loops:** Both functions use `while` loops. In `findNearestSplitPoint`, the loop iterates throu
gh regex matches, and in `chunkMessage`, it iterates through the remaining text. The overall time complexity
 is roughly linear in the length of the input message, which is generally considered efficient for text proc
essing tasks.
*   **`slice` and `trim`:** String `slice` and `trim` operations are generally efficient in JavaScript.

    **Efficiency Assessment:** The implementation appears to be reasonably efficient for typical text chunki
ng tasks. For extremely large messages, some performance optimizations might be possible, but for most use c
ases, the current efficiency should be sufficient.

**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **More Robust Sentence Boundary Detection:** The current regex `/[.!?]\s|\n/g` is a good start, but it c
ould be expanded to be more robust in detecting sentence boundaries. For example, it could consider:
    *   Handling cases where sentence-ending punctuation is followed by more than one space. `/[.!?]\s+/g`
    *   Considering quotation marks after punctuation (e.g., "Hello!".He said).
    *   Handling abbreviations (e.g., "Mr.", "Dr.") to avoid splitting after them. This is complex and might
 require a more sophisticated NLP approach, which might be overkill for this utility.
*   **Consider different splitting strategies if no sentence boundary is found:** Instead of just falling ba
ck to the last space, you could consider:
    *   Splitting at commas or semicolons as secondary split points.
    *   If absolutely no sentence boundaries or spaces are found within the limit, force a split at the char
acter limit, but potentially warn the user that the chunk might break words in the middle.
*   **Binary Search-like approach clarification:** The description mentions "binary search-like approach" bu
t the implementation doesn't really use binary search. It's more of a greedy approach, finding the *last* va
lid split point before the limit.  It might be more accurate to describe it as a "greedy, boundary-aware chu
nking" or simply "iterative, boundary-aware chunking". Or, if there's no plan to implement a binary search a
pproach, just remove that phrase for clarity.
*   **Add comments for complex logic:** While the code is relatively clear, adding comments to explain the f
allback logic in `findNearestSplitPoint` and the purpose of `actualSplitIndex` in `chunkMessage` could impro
ve readability for others.

**Example of Improved Regex (More robust whitespace handling):**

```javascript
const splitRegex = /[.!?]\s+|\n/g; // Matches one or more whitespace characters after punctuation
```

**Improved `findNearestSplitPoint` with comma/semicolon fallback:**

```typescript
function findNearestSplitPoint(text: string, targetIndex: number): number {
    const sentenceSplitRegex = /[.!?]\s+|\n/g; // More robust whitespace
    let lastMatch = 0;
    let match;

    while ((match = sentenceSplitRegex.exec(text)) !== null) {
        if (match.index > targetIndex) {
            break;
        }
        lastMatch = match.index + match[0].length;
    }

    if (lastMatch <= 0) {
        const secondarySplitRegex = /[,;]\s+|\s/g; // Comma, semicolon, or space
        while ((match = secondarySplitRegex.exec(text)) !== null) {
            if (match.index > targetIndex) {
                break;
            }
            lastMatch = match.index + match[0].length;
        }
        if (lastMatch <= 0) {
            return targetIndex; // Force split at limit if no better point found
        }
    }
    return lastMatch;
}
```

**Summary and Recommendations:**

1.  **Logic Soundness:** The core logic is sound and effectively addresses the requirement of chunking messa
ges at sentence boundaries while respecting the character limit.
2.  **Edge Cases:** The code handles most common edge cases well, with reasonable fallback strategies.
3.  **Efficiency:** The implementation is reasonably efficient for typical use cases, with roughly linear ti
me complexity.
4.  **Improvements:**
    *   Consider using the more robust regex `/[.!?]\s+|\n/g` in `findNearestSplitPoint` to handle multiple 
whitespace characters after sentence-ending punctuation.
    *   Optionally, enhance `findNearestSplitPoint` to consider commas/semicolons as secondary split points 
if no sentence boundaries are found. (Example provided above).
    *   Clarify the description of "binary search-like approach" as it's not a binary search implementation.
    *   Add comments to the code, especially in `findNearestSplitPoint`, to explain the logic and fallback s
trategies.

Overall, the `messageChunker.ts` implementation is well-structured and functional. The suggested improvement
s are mostly enhancements for robustness and clarity rather than critical fixes.
