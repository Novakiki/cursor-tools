Plan: Add a new command to list all available commands

**Step 1: Create the `ListCommandsCommand.ts` file**

Create a new file at `src/commands/ListCommandsCommand.ts` with the following content. This file will contain the implementation for the new `list` command.

```typescript
// src/commands/ListCommandsCommand.ts
import type { Command, CommandOptions, CommandGenerator } from '../types.ts';
import { commands } from './index.ts'; // Import the commands map

export class ListCommandsCommand implements Command {
  async *execute(query: string, options?: CommandOptions): CommandGenerator {
    yield 'Available commands:';
    for (const commandName of Object.keys(commands)) {
      yield `- ${commandName}`;
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Import and register the new command in `index.ts`**

Modify the `src/commands/index.ts` file to import the `ListCommandsCommand` and add it to the `commands` map.

```typescript
// src/commands/index.ts
import type { CommandMap } from '../types.ts';
import { WebCommand } from './web.ts';
import { InstallCommand } from './install.ts';
import { GithubCommand } from './github.ts';
import { BrowserCommand } from './browser/browserCommand.ts';
import { PlanCommand } from './plan.ts';
import { RepoCommand } from './repo.ts';
import { DocCommand } from './doc.ts';
import { ListCommandsCommand } from './ListCommandsCommand.ts'; // Import the new command

export const commands: CommandMap = {
  web: new WebCommand(),
  repo: new RepoCommand(),
  install: new InstallCommand(),
  doc: new DocCommand(),
  github: new GithubCommand(),
  browser: new BrowserCommand(),
  plan: new PlanCommand(),
  list: new ListCommandsCommand(), // Register the new command
};
```

**Step 3: Verify the changes**

After modifying the files, ensure that the code compiles without errors. If you have a build process, run it. For example, if you are using `tsc` for TypeScript compilation, you can run:

```bash
tsc
```

**Step 4: Test the new command**

To test the command, you would typically run the application with the new command.  Assuming the application is a CLI tool and the command is accessed by its name, you would run something like:

```bash
your-cli list
```

This command should output a list of all available commands, similar to:

```text
Available commands:
- web
- repo
- install
- doc
- github
- browser
- plan
- list
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`src/commands/ListCommandsCommand.ts`**: This file defines the `ListCommandsCommand` class.
    *   It imports `Command`, `CommandOptions`, `CommandGenerator` from `src/types.ts` to adhere to the command interface.
    *   It imports the `commands` map from `src/commands/index.ts` to access the list of registered commands.
    *   The `execute` method is an asynchronous generator function (`async *`) as defined by `CommandGenerator`.
    *   It iterates through the keys of the `commands` map (which are the command names) and `yield`s each command name, prefixed with a hyphen and a space for formatting.
    *   The `yield` keyword makes the function generate a stream of strings, which can be consumed by the calling code to display the output.

2.  **`src/commands/index.ts`**: This file is the central registry for all commands.
    *   We import the newly created `ListCommandsCommand` from its file.
    *   We add a new entry to the `commands` map: `list: new ListCommandsCommand()`. This registers the `ListCommandsCommand` under the command name `list`, making it accessible via this name in the application.

After these steps, the application will have a new command named `list` that, when executed, will display a list of all available commands. You can then integrate this command into your application's CLI argument parsing or command dispatch logic.
