Based on the provided file contents, **no, Neon's MCP client does not include an LLM itself.**

Here's why, based on the provided context:

* **MCP Client Purpose:** The documents describe the MCP client in TypeScript as a tool for connecting to and interacting with MCP servers. It's focused on tasks like connection management, tool invocation, and resource access.  Files like `src/mcp/MCPConnectionManager.ts` (mentioned in `plan.md`) and `local-research/mcp-client-typescript.txt`  suggest client-side implementation details for communication with MCP servers, not for embedding an LLM.
* **MCP Architecture:** The documents explain MCP as a client-server protocol. The client is a separate entity that connects to servers. The servers are the components that might be driven by LLMs to provide tools and context. The client's role is to facilitate communication, not to be an LLM itself.
* **"LLM as a driver"**:  `local-research/mcp-client-typescript.txt` mentions "creating an MCP client to interact with an MCP server using our LLM as a driver".  This phrase implies that the LLM is a separate component *using* the MCP client to interact with servers, not that the LLM is *inside* the client.
* **Marketplace and Server Discovery:** The plan documents discuss using the Neon MCP client's marketplace to discover and interact with MCP servers. This reinforces the idea that the client is a discovery and communication tool, and the intelligence (potentially LLM-driven) resides in the servers.

In summary, the Neon MCP client appears to be designed as a communication bridge to MCP servers, which might be powered by LLMs. The client's function is to connect, send requests, and receive responses, not to incorporate an LLM within its own code.
