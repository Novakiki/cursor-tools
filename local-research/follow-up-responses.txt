Based on the search results and available information, I'll address your follow-up questions about the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

1. For MCP Model Context Protocol:

Error codes and handling:
MCP defines standard JSON-RPC error codes, including ParseError (-32700), InvalidRequest (-32600), MethodNotFound (-32601), InvalidParams (-32602), and InternalError (-32603)[7]. Developers can define custom error codes above -32000. Error handling best practices include:
- Using appropriate error codes
- Including helpful error messages
- Cleaning up resources on errors
- Implementing proper timeouts[5][7]

Security measures for two-way communication:
- Use TLS for remote connections
- Validate connection origins
- Implement authentication when needed
- Validate all incoming messages
- Sanitize inputs
- Check message size limits
- Implement access controls
- Monitor resource usage
- Rate limit requests[7][6]

Transport layer failures and fallback:
The search results don't provide specific information about fallback mechanisms for transport layer failures in MCP. However, general best practices suggest implementing error handling for connection issues and potentially retrying connections or switching to alternative transport methods if available.

2. For MCP Client in TypeScript:

Documentation for MCP TypeScript SDK:
The search results don't provide a direct link to comprehensive documentation for the MCP TypeScript SDK. You may need to check the official MCP website or GitHub repositories for the most up-to-date documentation.

Debugging and logging tools:
- Enable debug logging in client applications
- Monitor network traffic
- Track message exchanges
- Record error states
- Use structured logging with consistent formats, context, and timestamps[5]

Best practices for managing multiple connections:
While the search results don't specifically address managing multiple MCP server connections, general best practices for network programming apply:
- Implement proper error handling for each connection
- Use connection pooling if appropriate
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Monitor connection health and implement reconnection logic

3. For MCP Directories for MCP Servers:

The search results don't provide specific information about MCP directory services, APIs for programmatic access, update frequency, or integration with cursor-tools. This information may be available in more specialized documentation or by contacting the MCP development team directly.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on these topics, I recommend consulting the official MCP documentation or reaching out to the MCP support channels.
