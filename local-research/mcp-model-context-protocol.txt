Querying perplexity using sonar-pro for: MCP model context protocol: what is it, and how is it defined? Provide details on its architecture, message formats, and available documentation. with maxTokens: 8000
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables secure, two-way connections between AI systems and various data sources[1][6]. It provides a universal protocol for connecting AI models with external resources, replacing fragmented integrations with a standardized approach[1].

MCP follows a client-server architecture[2]:

- Hosts: LLM applications (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDEs) that initiate connections
- Clients: Maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
- Servers: Provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

The core components of MCP include[2]:

1. Protocol layer: Handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

2. Transport layer: Manages actual communication between clients and servers. Supports multiple transport mechanisms:
   - Stdio transport: Uses standard input/output for local processes
   - HTTP with SSE transport: Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages and HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

3. Message types:
   - Requests: Expect a response from the other side
   - Results: Successful responses to requests
   - Errors: Indicate request failure
   - Notifications: One-way messages that don't expect a response

The connection lifecycle consists of three phases[2]:

1. Initialization
2. Message exchange
3. Termination

MCP defines standard error codes and error handling mechanisms[2].

Message Format:
An MCP message consists of three parts[3]:
1. Message name
2. Authentication key
3. Set of keywords and their associated values

Values can be simple or multiline. Simple values are provided in the same MCP message line as their keyword, while multiline values are spread over a series of MCP message lines[3].

Available Documentation:
- Official documentation and specification are available on GitHub[9]
- SDKs for TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin are provided[4]
- User documentation and guides are available[4]
- Server templates for Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin are provided[4]

MCP serves as a bridge between AI assistants and various systems where data resides, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments[1]. It aims to help frontier models produce better and more relevant responses by providing standardized access to contextual information[1].

By implementing MCP, developers can create more efficient and scalable AI applications, focusing on core functionality rather than managing complex integration logic[7].
