Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: In Node.js, there's a deprecation warning about the punycode module saying to use a userland alternative instead. Our dependencies are: @browserbasehq/stagehand@1.12.0, dotenv@16.4.7, eventsource-client@1.1.3, repomix@0.2.24, zod@3.24.1, and playwright@1.50.1 as a peer dependency. Which of these might be causing the warning and what are the possible solutions? Consider both bundling the punycode package with esbuild or making it an external dependency.
The punycode deprecation warning in Node.js 21+ is likely caused by one or more of your dependencies using the deprecated punycode module. Here are the potential culprits and solutions:

1. Likely causes:
- eventsource-client@1.1.3 (uses punycode indirectly)
- playwright@1.50.1 (may use punycode internally)

2. Solutions:

a) Update dependencies:
```
npm update eventsource-client playwright
```

b) Override punycode with a userland alternative:
Add to package.json:
```json
"overrides": {
  "punycode": "^2.3.1"
}
```

c) Suppress the warning (temporary):
Modify start script:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 node your-script.js"
}
```

d) Use esbuild to bundle punycode:
```javascript
// esbuild.config.js
require('esbuild').build({
  entryPoints: ['your-entry-point.js'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: 'dist/bundle.js',
  external: ['playwright'], // Make playwright external
  plugins: [
    {
      name: 'punycode-bundle',
      setup(build) {
        build.onResolve({ filter: /^punycode$/ }, args => {
          return { path: require.resolve('punycode') }
        })
      }
    }
  ]
}).catch(() => process.exit(1))
```

e) Make punycode external in esbuild:
```javascript
// esbuild.config.js
require('esbuild').build({
  entryPoints: ['your-entry-point.js'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: 'dist/bundle.js',
  external: ['punycode', 'playwright']
}).catch(() => process.exit(1))
```
