Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: In esbuild when bundling as ESM (format: 'esm') and getting 'Dynamic require of util is not supported', what's the best approach? The util module is already in externals. Is this related to CommonJS to ESM conversion? Should we handle it with a plugin like we did for punycode?
To address the "Dynamic require of util is not supported" error when bundling as ESM with esbuild, consider the following approaches:

1. Use a plugin to handle CommonJS to ESM conversion:

```javascript
import commonjsPlugin from '@chialab/esbuild-plugin-commonjs';

esbuild.build({
  format: 'esm',
  plugins: [commonjsPlugin()],
  external: ['util'],
  // other options...
});
```

This plugin helps convert CommonJS modules to ESM[8].

2. If the issue persists, you may need to create a custom plugin to handle Node.js built-in modules:

```javascript
const nodeBuiltinsPlugin = {
  name: 'node-builtins',
  setup(build) {
    build.onResolve({ filter: /^(util|os|path|crypto)$/ }, args => ({
      path: args.path,
      namespace: 'node-builtin'
    }));
    build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/, namespace: 'node-builtin' }, args => ({
      contents: `export * from 'node:${args.path}'; export { default } from 'node:${args.path}';`,
    }));
  }
};

esbuild.build({
  format: 'esm',
  plugins: [nodeBuiltinsPlugin],
  // other options...
});
```

This plugin intercepts requests for Node.js built-in modules and replaces them with ESM-compatible imports[4].

3. Ensure you're using the latest version of esbuild, as newer versions may have improved handling of CommonJS to ESM conversion[7].

4. If the issue is specific to certain dependencies, you can try adding them to the `optimizeDeps.include` array in your Vite configuration (if you're using Vite)[5].

These approaches should help resolve the "Dynamic require" error while maintaining ESM compatibility.
