## Description

cursor-tools should enable users to analyze repository context and answer questions about the codebase. The repo command should leverage AI models to understand the repository structure, code patterns, and functionality, providing context-aware answers to user queries.

## Failed Scenarios

- **Scenario 11:** Repomixignore file support - 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits."}}

## Detailed Results

### Scenario 11: Repomixignore file support (Other)

#### Task Description

We're going to verify that cursor-tools repo respects the .repomixignore file. First check that the .repomixignore file is either empty or not present. Use cursor-tools to analyze the repository, note how many tokens are used.
Then create a .repomixignore file using the content from /Users/andy/repos/cursor-tools-worktree/main/tests/feature-behaviors/repo/repo-command/repomixignore-with-src.txt and repeat the same query. Note how many tokens are used on the second query - it should be much less since we're excluding the src directory.
- Files that match patterns in the .repomixignore should not be included in the repository context sent with the repo command
- The repo command logs the number of tokens in the packed repo context
- Token usage is much less when there are significant ignores
- The repo command succeeds on both queries. Although for the 2nd query the answer may now be incorrect
- Command succeeds on both queries
- The second query has much lower token usage
