### Scenario 11: Repomixignore file support (Other)

#### Task Description

We're going to verify that cursor-tools repo respects the .repomixignore file. First check that the .repomixignore file is either empty or not present. Use cursor-tools to analyze the repository, note how many tokens are used.
Then create a .repomixignore file using the content from /Users/andy/repos/cursor-tools-worktree/main/tests/feature-behaviors/repo/repo-command/repomixignore-with-src.txt and repeat the same query. Note how many tokens are used on the second query - it should be much less since we're excluding the src directory.
- Files that match patterns in the .repomixignore should not be included in the repository context sent with the repo command
- The repo command logs the number of tokens in the packed repo context
- Token usage is much less when there are significant ignores
- The repo command succeeds on both queries. Although for the 2nd query the answer may now be incorrect
- Command succeeds on both queries
- The second query has much lower token usage
